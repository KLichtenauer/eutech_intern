2. Configure the script settings in the configuration file named config.txt.
3. Run the script using Python 3.
4. Review the log file `logfile.txt` for information on the backup process.

### 3. Configuration Settings

The configuration settings are specified in the `config.txt` file. The file should have the following format:

path to the backup folder (has to be relative to the script file):

files which should be backed up (has to be absolute paths):
-- following the paths to the different folders/files--


Adjust the values in the configuration file to suit your backup requirements.
